# fulfillment properties file for prototype fulfillment process using Amazon Simple Workflow
# All settings are consolidated in this file, but they could be broken out into different files
# for different purposes if that is desired.  Included in one central place for simplicity.

# There are some changes that necessitate a bump in version. Need to document these and try to
# come up with a process for making sure version is bumped on change. And for not killing all
# running workflows/tasks when we do that.
